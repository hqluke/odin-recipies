<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This will pack the protein into your frail body. The God's themselves couldn't think of a 
    more nutritious dish.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1lb 90/10 grass fed ground beef [92g protein]</li>
    <li>4 servings of egg whites (46g per serving) [20g protein]</li>
    <li>200g steamed white rice (carbs for fuel)</li>
    <li>100g vanilla flavored greek yogurt(use one with 0% fat) [17g protein]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place ground beef in a 12 inch pan and press down to spread it evenly</li>
    <li>Season your beef generously. You can't go wrong with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I personally
        use a box of spices that's called "Carne Asada Seasoning"
    </li>
    <li>I honestly don't know how long I wait until I flip it I just feel it out. Maybe
        5ish minutes? Once flipped, season the other side generously.
    </li>
    
    <li>Wait for a 2-3 minutes and add in your egg whites constantly stir the eggwhites with
        the beef so they mix well.
    </li>
    <li>Once your egg whites are cooked pretty well add in your rice and greek yogurt</li>
    <li>You can check to make sure the beef reaches 145 with a thermometer and 
        then you're done
    </li>
    <li>Enjoy</li>
